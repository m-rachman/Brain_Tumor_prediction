# Brain Tumor Prediction using MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning

## Project Overview

In this project, we will develop a deep learning model to predict the presence of brain tumors in radiographic images. The model will be based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, which is a lightweight, efficient, and accurate neural network designed for mobile devices.
